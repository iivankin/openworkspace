# OpenWorkspace

Self-hosted team mail on Cloudflare — personal and shared inboxes, passkey-only access, no passwords to manage.

One Worker, your domains, your data. Invite people with a link, grant mailbox access, and send and receive mail without running an MTA.

## Highlights

- **Passkeys only** — no passwords, invitations and recovery via one-time links
- **Personal and shared mailboxes** — multiple owned addresses plus read-only or read-and-send access per member
- **Multiple domains** — accept provisioned addresses across manually configured Cloudflare mail zones
- **Delivery status** — bounces, deferrals, and complaints surface in the app
- **Realtime and push** — mailbox-scoped WebSockets plus optional PWA notifications
- **Signed webhooks** — account-wide email and administration events with retry history
- **Runs on Cloudflare** — Workers, D1, Durable Objects, R2, Images, Email Service, and Queues

## Deploy to Cloudflare

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/iivankin/openworkspace)

Or clone and deploy from your machine (requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and a Cloudflare account):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iivankin/openworkspace.git
cd openworkspace
bun install
bun run deploy
```

Cloudflare provisions D1, R2, and the Images binding from `wrangler.jsonc`. Domain mail setup is manual — complete it once after the first deploy.

### Pull updates from upstream

The Deploy button creates a copy of this repo on your GitHub account. To take template updates later:

```bash
bun run sync:upstream
```

The script asks whether to run `bun install` and push to `origin`.
The script merges upstream (`main` or `master`) and keeps your Cloudflare-provisioned D1/R2 identifiers in `wrangler.jsonc`. Deploy-button copies often have no shared git history with this repo; the first sync allows unrelated histories and prefers upstream on conflicts, then restores your local D1/R2 ids. If a merge conflict remains, resolve it manually and keep your local `database_id` / `bucket_name`.

### Connect mail domains

For every domain used by a mailbox, configure Cloudflare manually:

1. **Email Routing** — In **Compute → Email Service → Email Routing**, enable Email Routing for the domain.
2. **Catch-all** — Under **Routing Rules**, enable **Catch-all**, choose **Send to a Worker**, and select this Worker.
3. **Outbound sending** — Under **Email Sending**, onboard the domain. Cloudflare adds SPF, DKIM, return-path, and DMARC records.
4. **Delivery events** — Open **Queues → openworkspace-delivery-events → Subscriptions**, subscribe to **Email Sending** for the domain, and select all six `message.*` events.
5. **First admin** — Open the app. With an empty database, the first-run screen creates your personal mailbox and registers you as administrator with a passkey.
6. **Profile photos** — Enable **Images** for the account if prompted. Create a public delivery variant named `public` (or `avatar`). Uploaded avatars use custom ids `avatars/<userId>` and are served from `https://imagedelivery.net/<account_hash>/avatars/<userId>/public` (not your Worker domain). Optional later: a custom Images delivery hostname in the dashboard.
7. **Attachment upload cleanup** — Run `bun run r2:lifecycle:setup` once to expire abandoned composer uploads after seven days. If the provisioned bucket is not named `openworkspace`, run `R2_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket> bun run r2:lifecycle:setup`.
8. **Direct attachment transfers** — Optional for the browser and required for MCP attachment transfers. Create an R2 API token (Object Read & Write) for the mail bucket and set `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`. In the R2 bucket **Settings → CORS**, allow your app origin with methods `GET`, `PUT`, and `HEAD` and headers `Content-Type`. Without these secrets, browser uploads still work through the Worker, but MCP attachment upload and download links are unavailable.
9. **Show original authentication** — Optional.
   1. Open [Cloudflare User API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) (**My Profile → API Tokens**, not **Account API Tokens**) and choose **Create Token → Custom token**.
   2. Grant **Zone → Analytics → Read** and scope the token to every mail domain used by OpenWorkspace. Copy the token when Cloudflare shows it; the value is displayed only once.
   3. Store the token on the deployed Worker. Wrangler prompts without putting it in shell history:

      ```bash
      bunx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN
      ```

   4. For each domain, copy **Zone ID** from its Cloudflare **Overview → API** section and enter it under **Administration → Domains**.

   Show original will display Cloudflare's SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and spam results for incoming messages. Analytics can only be fetched during Cloudflare's 31-day retention window; fetched results are retained with the message.
10. **AI mail processing** — Optional. Before enabling it, open **AI → AI Gateway → Credits Available → Manage** in the Cloudflare dashboard and top up the account's AI Gateway credits. An admin then enables OpenAI classification globally under **Administration → Mailboxes**. Mailbox members configure folders, the shared confidence threshold, and classification rules from the folder-management button beside that mailbox's folders. The original raw message is sent to the third-party `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` model as an `.eml` file without separately extracting images. Large messages use an estimate of three raw bytes per token and are truncated at 540 KB by omitting the end of the `.eml`; the 180,000-token target leaves a 20,000-token margin below the requested limit. The model checks for spam and selects one existing custom folder before realtime updates and push delivery. After two failed inference attempts, mail falls back to Inbox. Calls use Cloudflare Unified Billing, including local development, and fail when no AI Gateway credits are available; review the applicable Cloudflare and OpenAI data-retention terms before enabling it.
11. **Push notifications** — Generate one persistent VAPID key pair with `bun run push:keygen`. Set `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, and a contact such as `mailto:admin@example.com` in `VAPID_SUBJECT` with `wrangler secret put`. Users can then enable the current browser and choose mailboxes under **Settings → Notifications**. Each browser endpoint belongs directly to the current account and is rebound idempotently when the app starts. Natural session expiry and remote session revocation do not affect push; explicit logout detaches the current endpoint, while disabling notifications unsubscribes it from the browser.

Unknown catch-all recipients are rejected permanently. Only addresses you create in the app accept mail.

### Enable the OIDC identity provider

Each deployment can act as one OpenID Connect issuer for its existing users.
Configure the canonical public origin and an RSA signing key:

```bash
bun run oidc:keygen
wrangler secret put IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ORIGIN
wrangler secret put OIDC_SIGNING_PRIVATE_JWK
```

Use the exact HTTPS origin (for example `https://mail.example.com`) as
`IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ORIGIN`, and paste the generated JSON as
`OIDC_SIGNING_PRIVATE_JWK`. The same origin is used by SAML when both identity
providers are enabled.
Then open **Administration → OIDC applications** to register each relying
party's exact redirect URI, scopes, client type, and assigned users. A
confidential client secret is displayed once.

Clients discover the provider at:

```text
https://mail.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The provider supports Authorization Code with mandatory PKCE S256, public and
confidential clients, `openid profile email groups offline_access`, rotating
refresh tokens, revocation, UserInfo, and RP-initiated logout. Group membership
never grants application access; the client only receives group slugs selected
in its claim allowlist.

For signing-key rotation, retain the previous public JWK in a
`{"keys":[...]}` value under `OIDC_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_JWKS`, deploy the new private
key, and keep the previous public key published until old ID tokens and JWKS
caches have expired.

### Enable the SAML identity provider

The same deployment can issue SAML 2.0 assertions for configured service
providers. Generate a dedicated RSA key and X.509 certificate, then configure
the canonical public origin:

```bash
bun run saml:keygen
wrangler secret put IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ORIGIN
wrangler secret put SAML_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY < .saml/private-key.pem
wrangler secret put SAML_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE < .saml/certificate.pem
```

Open **Administration → SAML applications** to register each service
provider's Entity ID, exact ACS URL, NameID format, released attributes, user
assignments, and optional AuthnRequest signing certificate. The IdP metadata is
published at:

```text
https://mail.example.com/saml/metadata
```

The provider accepts SP-initiated AuthnRequest messages over HTTP-Redirect and
returns signed responses and assertions over HTTP-POST. Per-application launch
URLs provide IdP-initiated sign-in. Assertion encryption and Single Logout are
not enabled.

For signing-key rotation, first publish the next certificate in the
`SAML_ADDITIONAL_SIGNING_CERTIFICATES` PEM bundle. After service providers have
refreshed metadata, switch the private key and primary certificate, keep the old
certificate in that bundle, and remove it after metadata caches have expired.

## Local development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
bun install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Uncomment `ALLOW_MOCK_AUTH=true` in `.dev.vars` (dev only), then:

```bash
bun run db:setup:local
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Local seed includes an admin, a member, mailboxes, and sample messages. With mock auth enabled, **Open seeded local demo** skips WebAuthn.

| Fixture | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Invitation | `/invite/demo-invitation-token` (while signed out) |
| Passkey recovery | `/recover/demo-recovery-token` |

Outbound mail is logged locally instead of sent. To test push locally, add a key pair from `bun run push:keygen` and `VAPID_SUBJECT` to `.dev.vars`. Useful checks: `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, `bun run build`.

## Using the app

- **Empty install** — first visitor sets a name and personal email, registers a passkey, and becomes admin.
- **Invite users** — admin creates a person with a personal mailbox and shares the one-time invitation link. They register a passkey to join.
- **Recover access** — admin issues a one-hour recovery link; redeeming it replaces all passkeys and removes existing sessions and push registrations.
- **Settings** — each person manages their avatar, appearance, current-device push subscription, and per-mailbox notification preferences.
- **Mailboxes** — an admin can create multiple personal addresses for a user or shared addresses with read-only or read-and-send members. Each user has one primary personal mailbox for identity and recovery.
- **PWA notifications** — desktop and Android browsers can subscribe from Settings. On iPhone and iPad, first add OpenWorkspace to the Home Screen, then enable notifications from the installed app.

### Connect an MCP client

Open **Settings → MCP**, create a named personal token, and copy it immediately; the full secret is shown once. Configure the client with:

```text
Server URL: https://mail.example.com/mcp
Authorization: Bearer mcp_…
```

The token acts as its owner: mailbox access, send permission, account status, and role are checked on every operation. Mail tools can read raw messages in bounded chunks and issue 15-minute private R2 attachment links. To attach a file, call `create_attachment_upload`, PUT the exact declared bytes to the returned URL using the returned headers, then call `complete_attachment_upload` and pass its upload id to the send, reply, or forward tool. Administrator tokens additionally expose domains, mailbox ownership, user roles, destructive mailbox cleanup, Workers AI, group, and OIDC administration tools. Revoke a token from the same settings page to stop it immediately.

The endpoint supports both current MCP requests and stateless clients using the 2024–2025 protocol revisions.

### Configure outgoing webhooks

Administrators manage account-wide endpoints under **Administration → Webhooks**. Each endpoint chooses from email received/sent, user joined/updated, and mailbox lifecycle events. Email events include both the stored text and HTML bodies plus attachment metadata; attachment contents are not embedded.

Secrets are displayed only when an endpoint is created or rotated. OpenWorkspace signs the exact request body with HMAC-SHA256 and sends:

```text
x-openworkspace-delivery: whd_…
x-openworkspace-event: email.received
x-openworkspace-timestamp: 1787580000
x-openworkspace-signature: sha256=…
```

Verify the signature over `<timestamp>.<raw request body>`, reject stale timestamps, and deduplicate retries with `x-openworkspace-delivery`. Delivery runs asynchronously through Cloudflare Queues, retries up to five times, and retains the latest delivery status for 30 days. Administrator MCP tokens can also create, update, test, rotate, and delete webhook endpoints.
